# Hangman-2025
This project is a modern take on the classic childhood game 'Hangman,' where the goal is to correctly guess the letters of a hidden word and ultimately identify the word in its entirety. Made in 2025.

# How to Play
The screen displays a dotted line representing the mystery word and a podium where the stick figure will be drawn. To play, guess a letter. If the letter is incorrect, a body part of the figure appears. Each correct letter provides a clue to help you identify the word. At any point, you can attempt to guess the entire word. However, if your word guess is wrong, another body part is added. If the figure is fully drawn, the game ends with the character 'dead.' If you correctly identify all the missing letters or the word itself, you win! This engaging brain teaser is perfect for anyone looking to sharpen their vocabulary, critical thinking, and analytical skills.
